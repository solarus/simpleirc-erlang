#STARTUP: indent

An Erlang implementation of the `simpleirc' library found on Hackage:
  - http://hackage.haskell.org/package/simpleirc

See the examples folder for a very simple IRC-bot. Run the example by
executing `make test'.

* Todo
  - One gen_event for channels, one for ping etc...
    - channels done
  - Documentation!
  - Answer on ctcp ping.
  - What happends when the connection to a irc server is lost?
  - Write tests. Aka learn about eunit first :D
  - Implement dcc chat. If this chat can be encrypted and if there is
    a way to verify that code is safe then implement a feature to
    update the callback module code via dcc chat.
