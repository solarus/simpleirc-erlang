#STARTUP: indent

* Todo
  - Documentation!
  - Reimplement the callback module behaviour but this time with
    gen_event:add_handler and gen_event:notify to make sure there will
    no deadlocks.
  - Answer on ctcp ping.
  - Move simplebot to a examples directory and redo the makefile etc
    to reflect this.
  - What happends when the connection to a irc server is lost?
  - Write tests.
  - Implement dcc chat. If this chat can be encrypted and if there is
    a way to verify that code is safe then implement a feature to
    update the callback module code via dcc chat.
